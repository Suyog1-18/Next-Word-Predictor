🧠 Next Word Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a deep learning project that predicts the next word in a sentence using LSTM neural networks.

📁 Project
1. Next Word Predictor

Built a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras that learns from text sequences and predicts the most probable next word based on user input.

The model uses:

Tokenization for text preprocessing

Embedding layers for word representation

LSTM networks for sequence learning

Softmax classification for prediction

🛠 Tools Used

Python

NumPy

TensorFlow / Keras

Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Objective

To understand and implement Natural Language Processing concepts such as tokenization, embeddings, and sequence modeling using LSTM networks for next-word prediction.
